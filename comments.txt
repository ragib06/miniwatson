Here are the steps we followed in step two:

1. Pre-processing question string
    Removing extra whitespace characters or any other cleaning steps.

2. Generate Parse Tree
    We used a third party python parser names PyStat Parser to generate the parse tree of the sentence.

3. Semantic Attachment
    We traversed the parse tree to create a semantic grammar by attaching semantic information to the specific nodes.

4. Lambda Reduction
    The generated semantic grammar is then used to consume the input question and reduce lambda expression.
    It produces a function with some arguments. The principle verb stands for the function name
    and other tokens including the NPs goes for the arguments. For example, the question 'Did Swank win the oscar in 2000?'
    results into this function: win(2000,Swank).

5. SQL query generation
    Based on the generated semantic function, the corresponding sql query is created. An exhaustive list of rules are written
    to specifically facilitate a specific verb with its specific arguments.

6. SQL Query Execution
    The generated query is then executed in domain specific database. We used the project part-1 stuffs to get
    the domain of a question.

7. Show Result
    After we the sql query is executed the result is processed and the final answer is shown.
